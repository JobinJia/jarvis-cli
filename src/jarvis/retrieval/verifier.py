"""LLM-based verification for intent matches (shared by skills and MCP).

After the retriever + gate selects candidates, a lightweight LLM call decides
whether the user's request *actually* needs each candidate. It returns one of
three states:

  * ``confirmed`` — the LLM picked specific candidates; inject them.
  * ``none``      — the LLM says nothing applies; inject nothing.
  * ``unclear``   — the request is too vague to tell (or the LLM was
                    unreachable / unparseable). Don't act; let the caller ask
                    the user to clarify instead of guessing.

The ``unclear`` state is deliberate: an ambiguous prompt like "更新一下" must
not silently trigger ``update-deps``. When we can't confirm intent we surface
the candidates for clarification rather than command-injecting them.
