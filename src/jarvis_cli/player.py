"""Audio playback helpers.

`play(path)`            — afplay; reads a finished audio file from disk.
`play_stream(chunks)`   — ffplay; reads MP3 chunks from stdin so playback
                          starts before synthesis completes.
`StreamPlayer`          — the underlying one-process session; lets a caller
                          feed several chunk iterators (e.g. per-sentence TTS
                          streams) through a single ffplay pipe gaplessly.
`PCMPlayer`             — in-process raw-PCM sink via sounddevice/PortAudio;
                          same feed/close/abort surface as StreamPlayer but
                          no subprocess at all.
`open_pcm_sink(...)`    — PCMPlayer when sounddevice works, StreamPlayer
                          (ffplay) otherwise.

All accept an optional `on_spawn(handle)` callback so callers (the daemon
worker) can capture the playback handle for external cancellation — see
`Cancellable` for the contract that handle satisfies.

    those to ffplay is precisely the truncation bug documented on
    `pcm_sink_unusable` — so "no PortAudio" must mean "don't stream at all",
    not "stream somewhere worse". Both daemon callers already treat a raised

    device-level failure — the output device switched, Bluetooth headphones
    dropping out, the device momentarily busy — is transient, so it fails
    this one utterance and the next attempt opens PortAudio again. Latching
    those as well (briefly the case on 2026-08-25) would strand the daemon on
    the slower synth+afplay path for the rest of its life over a glitch that
